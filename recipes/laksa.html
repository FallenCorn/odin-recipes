    <p>Laksa is a spicy, curry or coconut-based noodle soup that originated from the Peranakans, who are of mixed Chinese-Malay heritage.Chinese men would set out onto the spice trade route and settle in their new villages, marrying the local Malay women. The result was a blending together of Chinese and Malay heritage. It is common to find traditional Chinese dishes that have been reformed using local spices and ingredients, thus creating a hybrid cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Types Of Laksa</h2>
    <p>There are many styles of laksa; it is most commonly differentiated into 3 categories: Curry, Asam, and Sarawak.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Curry laksa is a coconut milk-based laksa.</li>
        <li>Asam laska does not contain coconut milk, and it uses tamarind paste, which gives it a more sour/acidic taste.</li>
        <li>Sarawak laska is a combination of the two, where coconut milk is used, as well as tamarind paste. (Sarawak is a Malaysian state on the island of Borneo.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Make The Laksa Paste</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine all the red thai chili, shallots, ginger, galangal, garlic, lemongrass, macadamia nuts, coriander, cumin, tamarind paste, water, and canola oil. Pulse until a smooth paste is formed.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pureed paste into a large pot and cook over medium heat for about 30-40 minutes, stirring intermittently.</li>
        <li>Add in the sugar, curry powder, paprika, and salt, and stir for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If not using the paste right away, let the laksa paste completely cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week, or freezer for up to 6 months.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make The Laksa Soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If ready to make the laksa soup, add in 4 C of chicken broth and 1 can coconut milk to the laksa paste. Stir and bring to a simmer. If the consistency of the soup is a little too thick, add a little more chicken broth or water. Keep the soup warm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble The Laksa</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the rice vermicelli noodles into a serving bowl. Top with shredded chicken, shrimp, egg, tofu puffs, cucumber, and bean sprouts.</li>
        <li>Add the hot soup over top of the noodles.</li>
        <li>Squeeze some lime juice over top and garnish with laksa leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>*Tamarind paste can be difficult to find in some grocery stores. Look in Asian grocery stores or World Market.</p>
    <p><strong>If you can't find tamarind paste,</strong> you can substitute 1 ½ Tbsp fresh lime juice, 1 ½ Tbsp water, and 1 tsp brown sugar, mixed well, for the 3 Tbsp tamarind paste called for in this recipe.</p>
